The latest version of Native Oberon at the time of CD production requires a
numeric coprocessor, or a CPU with built-in floating-point support (e.g. Intel
486 or Pentium). However, a floating-point emulation module is in preparation.
This will be downloadable from ftp.inf.ethz.ch as soon as it has been
integrated in the system.
