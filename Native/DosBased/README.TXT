ETH Native Oberon System 3 Release 2.2 (DOS-based)

Native Oberon is a self-contained Intel-based PC operating system.

This text describes how to install DOS-based Native Oberon. This version uses
DOS as a bootstrap loader and embeds the Oberon file system in a large DOS
file. It is simpler to install than the stand-alone version, because it does
not require a separate disk partition. Refer to the stand-alone version
documentation for hardware requirements, additional package installation, legal
information and contact address.

REQUIREMENTS

Hardware: Same as for stand-alone Native Oberon.
Software: MS-DOS or Windows 95.

Note: If your mouse is equipped with only two buttons, use the CTRL-key as
substitute for the middle button. 

INSTALLATION

To install DOS-based Native Oberon, execute install.exe.
To reconfigure an installed DOS-based Native Oberon, execute config.exe.

RUNNING ON WINDOWS 95

This version will run on Windows 95 in MS-DOS mode. Note that it takes over the
entire machine, and it is therefore not possible to run it concurrently with
other applications. Selecting MS-DOS mode:
  1. Create a shortcut to "oberon.bat" (an icon is provided).
  2. Right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties" from the menu.
  3. Go to the "Advanced" menu in the "Program" tab and select "MS-DOS mode".
  4. Confirm the setting by clicking on "OK".
