RE-INSTALLATION OF OBERON

If you re-install Oberon or upgrade your Oberon version, you run
the risk of overwriting the files of your current configuration,
which you might have adjusted to your personal preferences. You can
make a backup of the "critical" files with the following Oberon
command in the old version before installing Oberon.

  DOSBackup.WriteFiles Oberon.INI EditKeys.Text TextPopups.Text
    Configuration.Text Access.Ring Public.Ring Private.Ring
    MailIn.DB MailOut.DB ~


STARTING OBERON

Double-click the shortcut "Oberon System 3 for Windows" on your
desktop.


QUITTING OBERON

The command System.Quit terminates the Oberon application. This is
the normal way to exit Oberon. Alternatively, the application
can be terminated by choosing "Close" in the application window's
system menu or by using the keyboard accelerator Alt-F4.


SUPPORT FOR TWO-BUTTON MOUSE

Oberon makes use of three mouse buttons. On systems with a two-
button mouse, the middle mouse button is emulated by the control
key on the keyboard. Pressing the control key is equivalent to
pressing the middle mouse button.
